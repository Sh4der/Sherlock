# Welcome To Sherlock
Sherlock is a simple to use offline voice assistant, it's based on the [rhasspy project](https://rhasspy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). 
It's an opensource project and is working local offline on your [Raspberry Pi](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi). So you don't need to worry about your privacy, it stays all on your own device. Unlike the Google Assiustant or Alexa, 
they upload all you say to them in their cloud to process it. This is not a good way, when you want to have a good privacy for example for vulnerable person.

# Why Sherlock?
Sherlock is a short, catchy word that is rarely used in everyday language. It also consists of two syllables and is

Mycroft Holmes. There is an open source language wizard called Mycroft.
