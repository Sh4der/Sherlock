# Disadvantages
 
## Not easy to setup
 
To get rhasspy running on a device like rhaspberry, many settings are required. In most of the cases, there is documentation available on web sites but they are not always updated and you need some more effort to get the correct setting. The information is also distributed on different pages and you need to find the relevant usages, which correspond to your current topic.
 
## Speech-To-text is not reliable
 
The Speech-To-text engine takes too much time to recognize a voice command and sometimes the recognition is not reliable.
 
## Artificial Text-to-Speech voice
 
Text-to-speech voice is very artificial and most of the time, much effort is needed to understand the output if you do not know what exactly is being spoken.
