## Keep Your Privacy
 
Unlike other voice assistants like Google, Alexa, etc, Rhasspy doesnâ€™t share data across the internet and this is very interesting for people, who are concerned about their privacy.
 
## Extendable
 
Once you have rhasspy as your voice assistance you can add additional features for your needs.
For example it is possible to train rhasspy to use your own voice for text to speech engine.
 
## Self Wake Word
 
Unlike for example google assistant, you can set your own custom wake word with rhasspy and change it frequently as you want.
 
## automated installation
 
It is possible to use a script or a docker to get rhasspy ready to use on other computers.
