# Zigbee2MQTT

Zigbee2MQTT allows you to use your Zigbee devices without the vendors bridge or gateway.

It bridges events and allows you to control your Zigbee devices via [MQTT](/pages/knowledge/mqtt.html). 
In this way you can integrate your Zigbee devices with whatever smart home infrastructure you are using.

To use Zigbee2MQTT you need a zigbee adapter. You can see a complete list
[here](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/information/supported_adapters.html){:target="_blank"}.

## Installation

[You can find the installation here](/pages/startup/setup-software.html#6-install-zigbee2mqtt)

## Connect a new device

Reset the device. To reset lamps in most cases you need to turn off and on the device 5 times.
