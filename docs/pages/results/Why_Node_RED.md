# Why Node-Red
Rhasspy works well with many home automation software such as :

### `Home Assistant`
Home Assistant allows you to control all your devices without storing any of your data in the cloud. We like to keep your privacy private. This is one of the best solutions for this project. 

### `OpenHAB`
is an open source home automation software written in Java. It keeps your data privately at home and talks directly to your local devices whenever possible but to get more functionality, it needs to be online. For this reason , we will not use OpenHaB for our project as our device will work at 100% offline.

## `Node-RED` :  our favorite to work with Rasspy

Node-RED is described as flow base programming for the internet of things. It provides a browser-based editor that makes it easy to wire together flows using the wide range of nodes in the palette that can be deployed to its runtime in a single-click.

Node-Red has different nodes which allows us to control our devices according to our needs. We will use this home automation for our current projekt.
