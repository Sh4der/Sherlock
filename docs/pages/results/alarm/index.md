# Alarm

## What is a Alarm?
A alarm is a feature, that reminds you of an event at a specific time. For example when you have a meeting with your dentist next week on Thurstday at 15:00.
Then you can set an alarm and Sherlock will remind you on this meeting.

## How to realize this feature?
We realized this feature with NodeRed. And in it we tested different solutions:
- [Programm it for your self with Javascript](alarmJS)
- [Use diffenent nodes](alarmNodes)
