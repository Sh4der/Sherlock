# Timer

## What is a Timer?
A timer is a feature, that reminds you of an event. For example you need a reminder for a pizza you put in the oven, 
you can say "Sherlock, stelle einen Timer auf 20 Minuten". Sherlock will ring in 20 Minutes and you are reminded that your pizza is ready.

## How to realize this feature?
We realized this feature with NodeRed. And in it we tested different solutions:
- [Programm it for your self with Javascript](timerJS)
- [Use diffenent nodes](timerNodes)
