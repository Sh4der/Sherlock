# AlarmNodes
The base idea was to set up an alarm with node based on the TimerNode but setting Timer with node was not successful as we expected because of some drop back relating to the node. For this reason we decided to set up an alarm with JavaScript.
To have a kick view on drop back for the node, please refer to this [link](/skills/timer/timer-nodes.md){:target="_blank"} .

For the implementation with Javascript,check [alarmJS](/skills/timer/timer-js.md){:target="_blank"}.
