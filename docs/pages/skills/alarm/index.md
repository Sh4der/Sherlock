# Alarm

## What is an alarm?
An alarm is a feature, that reminds you of an event at a specific time. For example when you have a meeting with your 
dentist next week on Thursday at 15:00.
Then you can set an alarm and Sherlock will remind you on this meeting.

## How to realize this feature?
We realized this feature with Node-RED and tested different solutions:
- [Program it for your self with Javascript](alarm-js)
- [Use different nodes](alarm-nodes)
