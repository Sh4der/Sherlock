# [Nano TTS](/pages/knowledge/tts/nano-tts)
[Nano TTS](/pages/knowledge/tts/nano-tts) is a text to speech system that we used in our project.

## Advantages
- Fast and lightweight
- Easy to understand
- Easy to install
- Can read long text

## Disadvantages
- The language is not fluid, it sounds really robotic
- No good pronunciation
- No german male voice, only a female voice

## Conclusion
Nano TTS works very fast, is lightweight, easy to install and can read long text aloud. Unfortunately, the language 
sounds very robotic, the pronunciation is not good and there is only one female German voice. Since we chose a male 
name for the voice assistant, a male voice would have been good.
