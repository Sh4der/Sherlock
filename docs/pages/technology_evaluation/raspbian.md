# Raspbian
Raspbian is the operating system we used on our Raspberry Pi. 

## Advantages
- Full support for the Raspberry Pi
- Very huge community, if you have any questions you can search for a solution on YouTube, in forums or on several other webpages ion the internet
- Easy to install, either with a tool from the [raspberry webpage](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/) or 
  with an image also from the [raspberry webpage](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/operating-systems/)
- Raspbian is officially supported by the Raspberry Pi
- Wide Hardware support
- Works out of the box

## Disadvantages
- The image is not the smallest.
- There are many packages installed we don't need

## Conclusion
Raspbian is a good operating system especially when you don't want to set up thousand things.
Beginner can start direct without much configuration. It is a good base for the rhasspy voice assistant.
